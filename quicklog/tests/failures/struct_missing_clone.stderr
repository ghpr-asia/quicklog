   | method `to_owned` not found for this struct
   | doesn't satisfy `SimpleStruct: Clone`

   = note: the following trait bounds were not satisfied:
           `SimpleStruct: Clone`
           which is required by `SimpleStruct: ToOwned`
   = note: this error originates in the macro `info` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
help: consider annotating `SimpleStruct` with `#[derive(Clone)]`
